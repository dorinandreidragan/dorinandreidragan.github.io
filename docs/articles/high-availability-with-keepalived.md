# 🔋⚡ Ensuring High Availability with Two-Server Setup Using Keepalived

Ensuring high availability with limited resources can be challenging. I recently wanted to prove you can do it using [Keepalived] and just two servers 💪✨. To prove it, I used [Vagrant]. Here's a quick rundown of my journey! 🚀

## Step 1: Creating the Vagrantfile

First, I created a Vagrantfile to define my virtual machines. This file specified the configuration for two Ubuntu 22.04 VMs, each with a unique MAC address and a static IP address in the same subnet.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Array of predefined MAC addresses
  mac_addresses = ["080027000001", "080027000002"]

  # Array of static IP addresses for the VMs
  ip_addresses = ["192.168.56.11", "192.168.56.12"]

  mac_addresses.each_with_index do |mac, index|
    config.vm.define "vm#{index + 1}" do |vm|
      vm.vm.box = "ubuntu/jammy64"
      vm.vm.network "private_network", ip: ip_addresses[index], mac: mac
      vm.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
        vb.name = "vm#{index + 1}"
        vb.memory = "512"
        vb.cpus = 1
      end

      # Provision Keepalived and Nginx
      vm.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y keepalived nginx
        # Example Keepalived configuration
        sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf <<EOF
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state #{index == 0 ? 'MASTER' : 'BACKUP'}
    interface enp0s8
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority #{index == 0 ? 100 : 90}
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1234
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.56.10
    }
}
EOF'
        sudo systemctl restart keepalived

        # Configure a simple web page to show role (MASTER or BACKUP)
        sudo bash -c 'echo "<html><body><h1>Server Role: #{index == 0 ? 'MASTER' : 'BACKUP'}</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html'
        sudo systemctl restart nginx
      SHELL
    end
  end
end
```

## Step 2: Spinning Up the VMs

With the Vagrantfile ready, I used Vagrant commands to create and start the virtual machines.

```bash
vagrant up
```

This command created and configured the VMs as specified in the Vagrantfile. Once the VMs were up and running, I could SSH into them to verify the setup.

```bash
vagrant ssh vm1
vagrant ssh vm2
```

## Step 3: Configuring Keepalived

The heart of this setup was the Keepalived configuration. The Vagrantfile already included provisioning scripts to install and configure Keepalived on both VMs. Here’s a recap of the configuration:

- **On the MASTER server:**

```plaintext
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface enp0s8
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1234
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.56.10
    }
}
```

- **On the BACKUP server:**

```plaintext
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface enp0s8
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 90
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1234
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.56.10
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Testing the Setup

With everything configured, it was time to test the setup. I started by verifying that the virtual IP (VIP) was correctly assigned to the `MASTER` server.

```bash
ip a show enp0s8
```

I then accessed the web server using the VIP to ensure it was reachable.

```bash
curl http://192.168.56.10
```

If the setup is correct, you should see the page that indicates which server (MASTER or BACKUP) is responding.

## Step 5: Simulating Failover

To test the failover functionality, I stopped the Keepalived service on the `MASTER` server.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop keepalived
```

I then checked the `BACKUP` server to see if it had taken over the VIP.

```bash
ip a show enp0s8
```

Sure enough, the `BACKUP` server had taken over, and the web server was still accessible via the VIP.

## Lessons Learned

This experience proved that high availability can be achieved with just two servers using Keepalived. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Simplicity and Power**: Keepalived is a powerful tool that is relatively simple to set up and configure.
2. **High Availability on a Budget**: Even with just two servers, you can achieve a high level of availability.
3. **Practical Testing**: Always test your setup thoroughly to ensure that failover works as expected.

## Conclusion

When it comes to ensuring high availability with limited resources, Keepalived is a great tool to have in your arsenal. I hope this article has inspired you to explore high availability setups further.
