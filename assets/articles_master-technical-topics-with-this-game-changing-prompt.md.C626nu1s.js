<span class="line"><span>Specifically, ask me:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>1. Do I want to start with the fundamentals</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   and gradually build up my knowledge on the topic over time?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>2. Do I want to start with a specific subtopic</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   within [TOPIC] that I want to deepen my knowledge on?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Once I give you my preference, proceed with the learning approach.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You should always make sure to ask me if I want to:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Continue with the current subtopic, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Switch to a different one throughout our sessions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Hereâ€™s how I would like the learning to be structured once Iâ€™ve made my choice:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Crystal-clear explanations that focus on the core intuition of the topic.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Analogies and real-world examples to make abstract concepts concrete.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Diagrams and illustrations whenever helpful.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Code examples in [LANGUAGES] or another relevant language.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Practical applications to reinforce my understanding.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Citations and references to trusted books, research papers, or articles to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  back up explanations and provide further reading.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Help me develop strong recall by:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Summarizing key takeaways after each lesson.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Asking me questions to test my understanding.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Suggesting practice problems with increasing difficulty.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Make sure explanations are:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Logical, structured, and beginner-friendly,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  while also deepening my knowledge over time.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- Engaging, without assuming prior knowledge beyond the basics.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If I struggle with a concept, break it down even further!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When citing sources, prioritize those that are well-recognized in the field,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>such as academic papers, textbooks, or respected online resources like</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>documentation or tutorials.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
